This project is written in C++11 and compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
It consists of the following four files:
- ECE5367_Project.exe
- main.cpp
- simulator.h
- simulator.cpp
- instruction.h

To run the program simply run the executable file (ECE5367_Project.exe).
The input file must be in the same folder as the executable file.
The program will create the output file. One does not need to already exist in the folder.

The program will prompt the user for an input file name and an output file name.
Enter the input file name followed by the output file name.
The file names should include the file extention and be separated by a space.

Example of correct input:

Enter the input and output file names (including the file extensions and separated by a space): input.txt output.txt[ENTER]

The output file will be generated in the same folder as the exectuable file and the input file.
